description: |
  Heart Disease dataset from UCI ML Repository (Cleveland subset). Contains various
  medical attributes to predict presence of heart disease.
size: ~920
features:
  count: 13
  names:
    - age
    - sex
    - cp  # chest pain type
    - trestbps  # resting blood pressure
    - chol  # serum cholesterol
    - fbs  # fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
    - restecg  # resting ECG results
    - thalch  # maximum heart rate achieved
    - exang  # exercise induced angina
    - oldpeak  # ST depression induced by exercise
    - slope  # slope of peak exercise ST segment
    - ca  # number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
    - thal  # thalassemia type
  types: mixed (numerical + categorical)
  categorical_features:
    - sex
    - cp
    - fbs
    - restecg
    - exang
    - slope
    - thal
    - dataset  # to be dropped
target:
  name: num
  classes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  type: multiclass (often binarized to 0 vs >0)
  notes: "0 = no disease, 1-4 = presence of disease (severity)"
actionability_examples:
  age: non_decreasing  # cannot get younger
  sex: no_change  # immutable
  chol: non_increasing  # can lower with treatment
  thalch: non_increasing  # max heart rate tends to decrease with age
  trestbps: none  # blood pressure can be modified
  fbs: none  # can be modified with diet
  ca: no_change  # medical measurement
  thal: no_change  # thalassemia is genetic
notes: |
  Classic medical dataset with excellent actionability constraint examples.
  Contains both numerical and categorical features. Target is often binarized
  (0 = healthy, >0 = disease present). Some columns like 'id' and 'dataset'
  should be dropped before use.
