description: |
  Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
  and Kidney Diseases. Contains diagnostic measurements to predict diabetes onset.
size: 768
features:
  count: 8
  names:
    - Pregnancies
    - Glucose
    - BloodPressure
    - SkinThickness
    - Insulin
    - BMI
    - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
    - Age
  types: all_numerical
target:
  name: Outcome
  classes: [0, 1]
  type: binary
  notes: "0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes"
actionability_examples:
  Age: non_decreasing  # cannot get younger
  Pregnancies: non_decreasing  # cannot un-have pregnancies
  DiabetesPedigreeFunction: no_change  # genetic/hereditary factor
  Glucose: none  # can be modified with diet/medication
  BloodPressure: none  # can be modified with lifestyle/medication
  BMI: none  # can be modified with diet/exercise
  SkinThickness: none  # can change with weight
  Insulin: none  # can be modified with medication
notes: |
  Excellent dataset for testing actionability constraints. Age and Pregnancies are
  naturally non-decreasing, DiabetesPedigreeFunction is genetic (immutable), while
  Glucose, BloodPressure, BMI are modifiable through lifestyle changes.
